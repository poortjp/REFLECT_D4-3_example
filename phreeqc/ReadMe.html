<H1>PHREEQC version 3</H1>
</center>
<FONT COLOR="black">

<P>Most important new features (relative to version 2.18):
<ul>
<li>Precise calculation of gas-solubilities with the Peng-Robinson Equation of State.
<li>Pressure effects on mineral solubilities.
<li>Multiple USER_GRAPH's with flexible -plot_xy function. It is possible
    to define line and symbol properties in addition to
    graph_x, graph_y from PfW. Used extensively in the examples, see, ex6 and ex19.
    Note that zedgraph.dll must be in the directory of phreeqc.exe.
<li>INCLUDE$ that allows to read in other files into the input file, and
    to execute them. The files can be written during the run with
    USER_PUNCH. See ex8 and ex21.
<li> .._MODIFY keywords that permit to change any model property, see ex20.
</ul>
<!--P>Download <A href="http://appt.home.xs4all.nl/temp/phreeqc3.exe"><i>phreeqc3.Installer.exe</i>’</A>, it will install phreeqc3 and Notepad++.-->

<p>PHREEQC version 3 is installed in c:\phreeqc and subdirectories:
<ul>
<li>MANUAL: the manuals and help file phreeqc.chm.
<li>EXMPLS: the examples from the manual. Run them with p.bat in a DOS window, for example:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p ex8.phr
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It will show 2 graphs and write the output file ex8.phr.out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, better, use Notepad++, see below.
<li>DATABASE: various databases.
<li>NP++: batch files that run PHREEQC tools from within Notepad++.
<li>PRESSURE: input files showing pressure effects on gas solubilities, scaling minerals. Run them with p.bat or run_all.bat in a DOS window, or with Notepad++.
<!--li>day_1..etc.: course exercises<-->
</ul>

<P>Notepad++ is recommended for writing, editing and running PHREEQC 3 input files.
<br>Notepad++ provides:
<TABLE width=1150  border=0>
<tr>
 <TD width="40%" bgColor="#ffffde" valign=top>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * syntax highlighting
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * autocompletion
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * calltips for BASIC functions and KEYWORDS
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * colored numbers (<FONT COLOR="red">1</font> and l are differently colored!)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * bracket matching: print (1 + 9.0) / <FONT COLOR="red"> (</font>9 + 1.0<FONT COLOR="red">)</font><blink>|</blink>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * (un)commenting multiple lines at once
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * column editor for easy BASIC line renumbering
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * shortcuts: e.g., Ctrl+F6 calls PHREEQC on the current file
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * file recognition on extension: .ppi .pqi .phrq .phr .dat .out
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sections in between a '#[' and  a '#]' can be folded up.
<p>Notepad++ will be installed along with the phreeqc3 files in your computer.
<p>Details are in the file c:\phreeqc\np++\Phr_in_NP++.txt.
