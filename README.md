# REFLECT_D4-3_example

Repository for an example of the workflow developed as part of work package 4 of the REFLECT project (https://www.reflect-h2020.eu/) for the uncertainty quantification of (barite) scaling in geothermal systems.

For more details on the workflow, file structure of this repository, and how to run the script, please refer to the "example_guide.pdf" document. Please note that the script in this example was specifically written to be used with the PHREEQC input file provided in this repository. If any changes are made to this input file or a different input file is used, the script might not function as desired anymore.

All scripts in this repository have been developed MATLAB version 2019a and tested on version up to 2021a, but cannot be guaranteed with certainty to work with other versions.
